In order to compensate for this, and have all the pages appear in the same position after the book is bound and cut, the pages must be slightly adjusted, depending on factors such as paper thickness. Each page is slightly adjusted by the value set in <strong>Page Creep</strong>. To understand exactly what this does, try setting <strong>Page Creep</strong> to half an inch, or about ten millimeters, and look at the results."
